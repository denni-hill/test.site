test todo application
this repository demonstrates work of my mvc framework, my web-design and front-end programming skills.
(todo.js - is ugly, I know =D. It was a test task from one of employers, so I didn't expect, that I will want to make this app as good as it is, so I didn't make any planning or design decisions => the code file became a Frankenstein)
